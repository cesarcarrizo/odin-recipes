    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound of fresh or dried tortellini</li>
      <li>8 cups of chicken or beef broth</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving</li>
      <li>Fresh parsley, chopped for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add a pinch of salt.</li>
      <li>
        Add the tortellini to the boiling water and cook according to the
        package instructions. Fresh tortellini will take about 2-3 minutes to
        cook, while dried tortellini will take about 5-7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the tortellini is cooking, heat the broth in a separate pot over
        medium heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the tortellini is cooked, use a slotted spoon to remove it from the
        pot and add it to the broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the tortellini simmer in the broth for a few minutes to absorb the
        flavors.
      </li>
      <li>Season the broth with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
      <li>
        Serve the tortellini al brodo in bowls and top with grated Parmesan
        cheese and chopped parsley.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Optional: you can add other ingredients to the broth such as diced
      carrots, celery or onion to make a more complex flavor or add some diced
      pancetta or prosciutto for a richer flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: You can use chicken or beef broth or make your own consommé,
      traditionally this dish is made with a consommé, which is a clear broth
      made from meat, bones and vegetables that have been simmered for hours.
