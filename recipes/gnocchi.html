    <p>
      Gnocchi are small dumplings that are traditionally made with potatoes,
      flour and eggs.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds of russet potatoes</li>
      <li>1 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Begin by boiling the potatoes in a pot of salted water until they are
        fork-tender. Drain the potatoes and let them cool for a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Peel the potatoes and pass them through a potato ricer or mash them with
        a fork.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the mashed potatoes out on a work surface and make a well in the
        center.
      </li>
      <li>Crack the egg into the well and add a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>
        Slowly incorporate the flour into the mashed potatoes and egg, working
        the mixture with your hands until a soft dough forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the dough into 4 pieces and roll each piece into a long rope
        about 1/2 inch in diameter. Cut the rope into small pieces, about 1 inch
        long.
      </li>
      <li>
        To shape the gnocchi, roll each piece of dough against the back of a
        fork with your thumb, creating a small indentation on one side and
        ridges on the other.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Gently drop the gnocchi
        into the boiling water, being careful not to overcrowd the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the gnocchi for about 2-3 minutes or until they float to the
        surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the gnocchi from the pot with a slotted spoon and toss with your
        desired sauce.
      </li>
      <li>Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh parsley.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Note: You can also add some semolina flour or flour with a higher gluten
      content to improve the texture of the gnocchi, also you can add some
      ingredients to the dough like spinach or beetroot to give them a different
      color.
